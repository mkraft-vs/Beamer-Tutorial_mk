    \begin{theorem} There is no largest prime number. 
    \end{theorem} 
    \begin{proof} 
        \begin{enumerate} \item<1-| alert@1> Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number. 
            \item<2-> Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers. 
            \item<3-> Then $q+1$ is not divisible by any of them. 
            \item<1-> Thus $q+1$ is also prime and greater than $p$.\qedhere 
        \end{enumerate} 
    \end{proof}
